Feature: Bing search in categories with filters

  Scenario: Switching filters without re-entering the search term
    Given I am on the Bing homepage
    When I search for "<search_phrase>"
    And I filter results by "Everything"
    Then I should see search results related to "<search_phrase>"
    When I switch to the "Videos" category
    Then I should see video results related to "<search_phrase>" without needing to re-enter "<search_phrase>"
    And the search field should still contain "<search_phrase>"

    Examples:
    | search_phrase |
    -----------------
    | semrush       |

  Scenario: Video results show metadata
    Given I am on the Bing homepage

    And each video should display its duration, uploader name, and upload date

    Examples:
    | search_phrase |
    -----------------
    | semrush       |

  Scenario: News results from last 24 hours
    Given I am on the Bing homepage
